# Vaccine Tracker App
For this project, I created a basic unhosted application to visualize the vaccination rates accross the US. Since the application is not hosted, it will need to run on a local host. 
It is a set of three charts that change based on the inputs provided by the user: 
    1. A chart of the theoretical growth of a disease depending on its reproductive rate. 
    2. The Herd Immunity Threshold chart and a point showing the theoretical percent of the population for herd immunity.
    3. Bar graph of the US states and the respective percent vaccinated
